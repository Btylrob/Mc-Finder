# üçî McDonald's Image Classifier

A deep learning application that classifies McDonald's menu items from images using TensorFlow and Keras. Each class is an item from the current McDonald's Menu as of April 2025.  
STILL IN PRODUCTION NOT READY FOR USE **

## üß† Project Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of McDonald's food items into multiple categories. The model was trained on a dataset of images pulled from google with some being from the original McDonald website and others being from related images. This project can be used either by cloning the repository to your terminal or using my hugging face spaces which I will link in resources. This is my first machine learning project and I have some instructions in another markdown file to annotate what each section of code  means if anyone wants to replicate somethings similar with my findings from research during this project.

## üóÇ Dataset

The dataset follows this structure:

---

## üí° Future Improvements

- Add support for breakfast items and drinks

- Expand the dataset for better generalization

- Add a Gradio interface to host on HF Spaces

- Add camera support for real-time food classification
